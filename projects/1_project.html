In both our simulation and physical neuromorphic systems, the random walk of particles mimics how material precursors diffuse through a medium before deposition. The directional bias we’ve implemented parallels how electric fields guide the growth of conductive pathways in physical neural networks. This is crucial for creating self-organizing hardware that can form functional connections without explicit programming. The Margolus neighborhood approach we use captures the local interaction rules that determine how these structures branch and connect, similar to how memristive devices form conductive filaments through ion migration—a diffusion-driven process that changes resistance states based on applied voltage and material properties.</p> <h3 id="biological-neural-development">Biological Neural Development</h3> <p>Neural development is fundamentally a diffusion-limited process where our simulation approach excels. Dendrite growth in biological neurons follows a process remarkably similar to our model: growth factors diffuse through the extracellular matrix, creating concentration gradients that guide dendrite extension. Our simulation’s stochastic diffusion with directional bias accurately captures how these chemical gradients influence growth cone navigation. The fractal patterns emerging in our model mirror the self-similar branching observed in real neurons, where each branching decision is influenced by local molecular interactions. The computational efficiency of our Margolus shuffling technique allows us to simulate these complex diffusion dynamics at scales relevant to actual neural development, making it possible to model how subtle changes in the diffusion environment can lead to dramatically different neural architectures—a key insight for understanding both normal development and pathological conditions.</p> <h3 id="semiconductor-manufacturing">Semiconductor Manufacturing</h3> <p>Semiconductor fabrication increasingly relies on bottom-up self-assembly processes that are inherently diffusion-limited, making our simulation approach highly relevant. In processes like chemical vapor deposition, precursor molecules diffuse through a gas phase before depositing on a substrate—exactly the type of random walk with sticking rules that our model simulates. The horizontal bias field in our implementation mirrors how electric fields or temperature gradients can direct the growth of nanowires and other semiconductor structures. Our approach is particularly valuable because it captures the stochastic nature of these processes while still accounting for directional influences, allowing manufacturers to predict how process parameters will affect the resulting structures. The emergent fractal dimensions in our simulation correspond directly to the surface roughness and porosity of deposited films, which critically affect semiconductor device performance through properties like electron mobility and optical characteristics.</p> <h3 id="electropolymerization">Electropolymerization</h3> <p>Electropolymerization represents perhaps the most direct application of our diffusion-limited aggregation model. During this process, monomers diffuse through an electrolyte solution toward an electrode where they undergo oxidation and subsequent polymerization—a process perfectly captured by our particle diffusion and aggregation rules. The horizontal bias in our model directly corresponds to the electric field gradient that drives this process, with stronger fields creating more directionally elongated polymer structures. Our simulation accurately reproduces the dendritic growth patterns observed in real electropolymerization, where polymer chains branch out from the electrode surface in fractal patterns. The diffusion-limited nature of this process creates concentration gradients that our model captures through the probabilistic movement of particles. By adjusting parameters like diffusion rate and field strength, our simulation can predict how changes in electrolyte concentration, applied voltage, and electrode geometry will affect the resulting polymer morphology—insights that are difficult to obtain through experimental methods alone but crucial for optimizing electropolymerization for applications in sensors, actuators, and energy storage devices.</p> <h3 id="self-organizing-systems-in-ecology">Self-Organizing Systems in Ecology</h3> <p>Our dendrite simulation approach provides remarkable insights into self-organizing ecological systems, particularly in vegetation pattern formation in semi-arid ecosystems. These ecosystems exhibit striking regular patterns of vegetation alternating with bare soil—a phenomenon driven by diffusion-limited resource distribution. Our model excels at capturing this process because the core mechanism is fundamentally similar: water and nutrients diffuse through soil, with plants acting as “sticky” aggregation points that deplete resources in their immediate vicinity while benefiting from resources at greater distances. The horizontal bias component of our simulation perfectly models how topographical gradients influence water flow and subsequent vegetation growth patterns. What makes our approach particularly powerful for modeling these systems is the Margolus neighborhood implementation, which efficiently captures the short-range facilitation (plants helping nearby plants by improving soil conditions) and long-range competition (plants competing for scarce water resources) that characterize these ecosystems. The emergent fractal patterns in our simulation closely match the spatial distributions observed in real tiger bush, spotted vegetation, and labyrinth patterns found in nature. By adjusting diffusion rates and bias strength, our model can predict how climate change might alter these self-organizing vegetation patterns—a critical tool for understanding ecosystem resilience and potential tipping points in these fragile environments.</p> <h3 id="cellular-automata-theory-and-applications">Cellular Automata Theory and Applications</h3> <p>This project contributes to the broader field of cellular automata research by demonstrating how specialized CA rules can model complex physical phenomena. While traditional cellular automata like Conway’s Game of Life use fixed neighborhood patterns, our implementation showcases the power of the Margolus neighborhood for modeling physical systems with conservation laws. The project demonstrates how cellular automata can bridge the gap between discrete computational models and continuous physical processes, providing insights into how simple rules can generate complex emergent behaviors. Our implementation also shows how cellular automata can be modified to incorporate directional biases while maintaining their fundamental discrete nature, expanding the theoretical toolkit for CA researchers and practitioners.</p> <h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2> <p>Potential extensions to this project include:</p> <ul> <li>Implementing 3D diffusion-limited aggregation</li> <li>Adding multiple bias fields with different orientations</li> <li>Incorporating temperature effects on the diffusion process</li> <li>Parallelizing the simulation for larger scale structures</li> <li>Exploring different cellular automaton rule sets to model various physical constraints</li> <li>Developing hybrid models that combine cellular automata with differential equations for multi-scale modeling</li> </ul> <p>If you’re interested in contributing or have questions about the implementation, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request on the GitHub repository.</p> </article> <h2>References</h2> <div class="publications"> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Lukas M..
