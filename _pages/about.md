Hi, this is Lukas! I'm in the final stages of my PhD in Physics, which I pursued at Dresden University of Technology (Germany) and partly Stanford University (US).

My PhD studies focus on a certain type of carbon-based transistors, so-called organic electrochemical transistors, which are interesting for neuromorphic computing and brain-machine interfacing. In particular, I worked on a thermodynamic model to understand the memristive behavior of these systems, which I supplemented by quantum mechanical methods. I also work on a tensor and Markov model that allows me to simulate the semiconductor in a coarse-grained fashion, both in and out of equilibrium.

I also hold a second Master's degree in Economics from FU Hagen, where I learned to appreciate the astonishing resemblance between models in finance and physics. I completed my final thesis at the chair of investment theory and business valuation.

I'm a curious mind and think about a broad range of subjects, but it most often converges to some mixture of thermodynamics, information theory, and artificial, conscious intelligence. This also connects to my general interest in non-reductionist world models and complex systems theory.
